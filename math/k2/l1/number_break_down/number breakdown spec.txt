🎮 Game Specification: Number Breakdown Animal Feeding Game
📌 Objective

Create an educational game that teaches children how to break down numbers into smaller equations.
The learning focus is number decomposition (e.g., 8 → 4+4, 6+2, 2+3+1+2).
The metaphor: feeding animals in a shelter with treats (fish for cats, bones for dogs).

🐾 Game Modes

Single Number Breakdown (Default start mode)

The game provides one number (e.g., 5).

The player must distribute that many treats across animals.

At least 2 animals are always created.

UI example (Case 1 in mock):

Top: “We have 5 fish to share.”

Treats displayed visually.

Tree breakdown: player assigns treats → result shown (e.g., 3+2=5).

Equation Breakdown

The game provides a simple addition equation (e.g., 2+3).

Dogs = first number → bones.

Cats = second number → fish.

Player must feed both groups separately.

UI example (Case 2 in mock):

Left side = dogs with bones.

Right side = cats with fish.

Tree breakdown shows how each part of the equation is fed (2+3=5).

Mixed Mode (Default mode)

Alternates between Single Number and Equation cases.

The first round always starts with Single Number Breakdown.

🧩 Gameplay Rules

Animal Count

Default = 3 animals.

Configurable = fixed number OR “Random.”

Random range = 1 → target number.

Example: target 5 → between 1 and 5 animals can spawn.

Treat Distribution

Player assigns treats visually (drag & drop or click-to-assign).

The sum of treats must match the given number (or equation parts).

Correct solution = tree structure displays equation (e.g., “3+2=5”) + celebration.

⚙️ Configuration Options

Game Mode: Single, Equation, or Mixed.

Animal Count: Fixed (default = 3) or Random (1 → target number).

🌟 Learning Value

Visualizes number decomposition through tree diagrams.

Builds understanding of additive equations step by step.

Encourages exploration of multiple valid solutions.

Uses animals and treats to reduce anxiety and make math playful.

🎨 UI & Visual Structure

Case 1 – Single Number Breakdown

Header: “We have X treats to share.”

Treats displayed in a row.

Tree structure showing how treats are split among animals.

Example: 5 fish split → Dog gets 3, Cat gets 2 → “3+2=5.”

Case 2 – Equation Breakdown

Header: “We need to feed the cats and dogs.”

Dogs shown with bones = first number in equation.

Cats shown with fish = second number in equation.

Tree structure shows breakdown.

Example: 2 bones → dog, 3 fish → cats → “2+3=5.”
